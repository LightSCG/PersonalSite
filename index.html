    Hi welcome to my personal website! My name is Stephen Diehl and I am currently
    working on becoming a Front-End Developer as to improve myself and actually
    get started with a career. I have mostly worked fast food and spent my time playing
    video games but it's high time I fixed all that and actually did something productive
    and useful!
